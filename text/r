[4] Ok you're building a small "webhosting panel" ? What about its security or having users?

- Somehow you can call it a small "Web Hosting Panel" But this is something like a personal panel.
Which mean i'm not thinking to care about a way to create clients. About users maybe there will be because i'm thinking to ex create a user which should care about backups, create a user which should monitor webserver. etc.
So this is just for personal usage and you shouldn't like adding a new vhost and creating a user to manage it because that user may have bad interests and can access data which he shouldn't!!

[5] Required System.
```
  - +2GB RAM.
  - +1 CPU Cores.
  - +20 GB OF SPACE PREFERED SSD BUT IT WILL NOT BE BAD EVEN IF IS HDD.
  - 1GB/s Uplink. (When using all features in one place!)
```
